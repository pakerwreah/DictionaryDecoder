# DictionaryDecoder
A Swift library for deserializing `Decodable` types from `[AnyHashable: Any]`.
Useful for decoding push notification dictionaries.

This is a stripped-down version of [swhitty/DictionaryDecoder](https://github.com/swhitty/DictionaryDecoder), containing only the `DictionaryDecoder` class.
